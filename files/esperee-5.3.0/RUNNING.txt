            ===================================================
            Running The Esper Enterprise Edition Server
            ===================================================

Esper Enterprise Edition requires the Java 2 Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 7.0 or later.

Please open index.html for introduction and all documentation links.

Review the LICENSE.txt file before running. By following below instructions 
you agree to accept the provided license terms.

=========================================================
Running With JRE (Java Runtime Env.) version 7.0 Or Later
=========================================================

(1) Download and Install the J2SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download the Java 2 Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 7.0 or later, from http://java.sun.com/j2se.

(1.2) Install the JRE (or JDK) according to the instructions included with the
      release.
(1.3) Set an environment variable named JRE_HOME to the pathname of
      the directory into which you installed the JRE, e.g. c:\jre7.0
      or /usr/local/java/jre7.0.

NOTE: You may also use the full JDK rather than just the JRE. In this
      case set your JAVA_HOME environment variable to the pathname of
      the directory into which you installed the JDK, e.g. c:\j2sdk7.0
      or /usr/local/java/j2sdk7.0. Please ensure JAVA_HOME points to a JDK 
      and not a JRE.

(2) Download and Install the Esper Enterprise Edition

(2.1) Download a binary distribution of EEE from:

      http://www.espertech.com/community

(2.2) Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
      distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
      "esperee-[version]").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
      the symbolic name "$ESPEREE_HOME" is used to refer to the full
      pathname of the release directory.


(3) Start Up Esper Enterprise Edition Server

(3.1) Esper Enterprise Edition Server can be started by executing the following commands:

      $ESPEREE_HOME\bin\startup.bat          (Windows)

      $ESPEREE_HOME/bin/startup.sh           (Unix)	

(3.2) After startup, the default web applications included with Esper Enterprise Edition will be
      available by visiting:

      http://localhost:8400/esperhqapp/index.html

(3.3) Further information about configuring and running Esper Enterprise Edition can be found in
      the documentation included here in the "docs" folder.
      
(4) Esper Enterprise Edition Server

(4.1) Esper Enterprise Edition Server can be shut down by executing the following command:

      $ESPEREE_HOME\bin\shutdown            (Windows)	

      $ESPEREE_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh         (Unix)

(4.2) Additional command line options can be printed:

      $ESPEREE_HOME\bin\esperee 	    (Windows)	

      $ESPEREE_HOME/bin/esperee.sh          (Unix)

(4.3) Additional run-command options can be printed:

      $ESPEREE_HOME\bin\esperee run -? 	    (Windows)	

      $ESPEREE_HOME/bin/esperee.sh run -?   (Unix)

================
Troubleshooting
================

There are only really 2 things likely to go wrong during the stand-alone
Esper Enterprise Edition install:

(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    matter) has laid claim to one of the ports that is used by Esper Enterprise Edition.  
    
    (A) Check the web server port: By default this port is 8400.
        Esper Enterprise Edition attempts to bind to that port at startup.  To change this, open the file:

           $ESPEREE_HOME/conf/esper-default.xml

        and search for '8400'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
        greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
        access to bind under UNIX.

    (B) Check the JMX port: By default this port is 1099.
        Esper Enterprise Edition uses this port to allow remote shutdown. It attempts to bind to that port at startup.  
        To change this, open the file:

           $ESPEREE_HOME/conf/esper-default.xml

    (C) Check the JMS provider port: By default this port is 61616.
        Esper Enterprise Edition uses this port for messaging. It attempts to bind to that port at startup.  
        To change this, open these three files:

           $ESPEREE_HOME/conf/esper-default.xml (starts JMS provider, an Esper config file)
           $ESPEREE_HOME/conf/ceppushsvc-default.xml (push services config file)
           $ESPEREE_HOME/conf/esperhq-default.xml (web application config file)

   Restart Esper Enterprise Edition.  Be sure that you replace the "8400"
   in the URL you're using to access the Esper Enterprise Edition web client.

(2) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a
    proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your
    browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the
    "localhost".
