- Support for all new Esper 4.0.0 and EsperHA features
- Support for launching eventlets passing a URL; For example, "url=file:my_eventlet.xml" to launch from a stored definition file on the file system data directory.


Changes in version 3.5.1
------------------------
- A plug-in eventlet may now be an SWF module. We thus simplified loading eventlets as SWF modules are supported by the IDE.
- When launching eventlets via URL parameters (aka. faceless launch) applications must now use the esperhqlaunch.swf object or esperhqlaunch.html page. 
  The esperhqlaunch application is optimized to load minimal resources for launching an eventlet in a browser window or iframe.
- Control panels for eventlets are now modeless pop-ups that closes when the eventlet window closes and may be toggled from the MDI window menu or right-click.
  This prevents the eventlet to resize and the control panel to require scroll bars.
- The grid eventlet now features nesting and additional configuration options.
- Added style property configuration to eventlets and accordingly style edit dialog to eventlet wizard.
- Added application builder: A drag and drop page builder for organizing a page of eventlets and text/HTML to a composite application page.
- Added EventletDisplay ActionScript component to the "eventletsvc" Flex library for use with applications that want to compile against BlazeDS services descriptor.
- The distribution now delivers the WAR file exploded in the webapps directory.
- Upgrade to Flex SDK 4.1.0 and BlazeDS 4.0.1
- Bug fix release for Esper 3.5.1, not certified with EsperHA 3.5.0

Known limitations:
- When hot deploying a WAR web application the EsperHQ client may not come up in the case when the client has not been brought up at least once after server start.
